# A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words (100)

## Problem

A picture is worth a thousand words. Can you find the (JPEG) picture among a thousand files? Connect to the EasyCTF SSH server and find the files in `/problems/1000words`. The files are also available for download [here](files/data.zip).

## Hint

Grep is always your friend.
