# Known Plaintext 3 (300)

## Problem

Solve the problem using the programming interface. The input file is `knownplaintext3.in`.

The input is formatted `[d/e] <string>`. The first character specifies whether the assignment is to encrypt or to decrypt, and the string is either the plaintext or the ciphertext, depending on the first letter.

## Hint

Figure it out yourself ;)
