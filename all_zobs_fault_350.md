# All Zob's Fault (350)

## Problem

Apparently our crypto program didn't store the correct phi-value or something for this [message](files/all_zobs_fault.txt); it spits out gibberish when we try to decrypt it. Either the memory had a rare fault or Zob's being an idiot again. Please help.

## Hint

Zob works at the Russian Space Agency.
