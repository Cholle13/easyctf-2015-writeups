# Hijacked! (100)

## Problem

Someone planted a file on our computer (the [shell server](https://www.easyctf.com/shell)), but we don't know what it is! The only clue that we have is that it's owned by a user called `l33t_haxx0r`. Can you figure out the flag?

## Hint

Try to look up useful Linux commands.
