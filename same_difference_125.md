# Same Difference (125)

## Problem

*Solve this problem by connecting to the EasyCTF shell, either in your browser or through some other TTY.*

We've noticed that a list of passwords has been modified. Compare the original `master_copy.txt` to the `suspicious.txt` and tell us what the password was changed to! The files are on the shell server at `/problems/same_difference`.

This can be solved only with the tools available in the shell. No scripting languages are required.

## Hint

There's a pretty cool Linux command called `diff` that might be useful for you.
