## Problem

My name is Michael Zhang.

## Hint

This is a recon problem. Clues are scattered over the internet, and you have to piece them together to solve the problem. THIS IS INSANELY HARD. If you solve this problem, you are required to write a write-up and send it (using the email you signed your team up with) to [failed.down@gmail.com](mailto:failed.down@gmail.com).
