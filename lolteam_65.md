# lolteam (65)

## Problem

There's a suspicious team out there called **lolteam**, I got my eyes on them for a while and I managed to [wiretap](files/lolteam.pcapng) their browser as they were changing their password. What did they change their password to?

## Hint

Don't know how to open [.pcapng](http://fileinfo.com/extension/pcapng) files?
