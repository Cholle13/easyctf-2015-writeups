# San Francisco Symphony (75)

## Problem

Who knew musicians could program? They put a flag inside `/problems/sfs/sfs`! But when I run the program, it's not printing out the flag. Find the flag!

## Hint

Darn. That `c` file isn't going to help much either. How can we find the flag using only the binary?
