# Wastebin 2 (250)

## Problem

So after the previous fiasco, I decided to generate a random `admin` password, and hide it in a file that no one will ever find. And don't try Googling it either, cuz Google can't find it either! Hahaha >:) [Link](http://web.easyctf.com:10207/2/index.php)

## Hint

Where can you find out what files are in a server?
