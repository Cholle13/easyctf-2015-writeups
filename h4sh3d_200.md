# H4sh3D (200)

## Problem

We discovered that Varsos's server uses a fairly insecure hash function to check passwords. The hashed password is `c9b5af9864efa933`, and the hashing function can be found [here](files/hash1.py).

## Hint

Seems like working backwards will be a pain. Is there any easier way?
