# iSpy (120)

## Problem

We intercepted some suspicious network activity. We think that the enemy has been exchanging important data. Can you help us figure out what it is? You can find a copy of the file [here](files/ispy.pcapng).

## Hint

You're going to need to be able to open that file. Something like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) might help.
