# Matrices (575)

## Problem

Looks like Zob tried to make his own encryption algorithm again; [here's](files/matrix.java) the program. [Here](files/message1), [here](files/output1), and [here](files/output2) are two messages encrypted with the same key and the plaintext of one of the messages. Convince Zob to stop trying to make his own ciphers!

## Hint

Technically, all the math you need for this problem you learned in Algebra 2.
